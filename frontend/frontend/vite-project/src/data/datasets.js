    description: "The Iris dataset is a classification dataset with 150 samples and 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), each having 50 samples. It contains 4 numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in cm). The dataset is best suited for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, but Deep Learning (DL) can also be used, though it's unnecessary due to the small size. It is also useful for clustering tasks like K-Means.",
